# JS Carousel

This exercise aims at building an image carousel using Javascript,
with the Html,Css files and images provided by the teachers.

Steps:

1. Remove the containers with images attached from the Html,these will be added later.

2. In the Js file, create an array containing the references to the images, then fetch
    the IDs of the button and set the variable the counter will compare against to 0.

3. create a counter that will create and append the containers and images inside the
    main container, then select them all and place them under one variable.
    
4. Create 2 event listeners, one for each of the buttons, that will switch the class responsible 
    to handle the desired image in a progressive way, depending on the button pressed.
